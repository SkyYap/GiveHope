# Root Application Component (`src/App.tsx`)

`src/App.tsx` serves as the root component of the React application. It is responsible for:

- Setting up client-side routing using `react-router-dom`.
- Configuring Web3 providers (`WagmiProvider`, `RainbowKitProvider`) for blockchain interaction.
- Integrating `react-query` for data fetching and caching.
- Defining the main layout of the application, including `Header` and `Footer` components.
- Managing application routes and rendering the appropriate page components (`Home`, `Discover`, `ProjectDetails`, `CreateCampaign`, `About`).
